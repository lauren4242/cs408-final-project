# Web Dev Starter Code

## Project Spec

TODO: Write a project spec
What is the general theme? For example, a photo gallery, recipe repository, Twitter clone, e-commerce inventory, API-driven data mining, generic wedding, a message board for the class, dentistry, etc.
What is it going to do? For example: draw customers to a photography business by showing a portfolio, pricing, contact information, and booking. Mine data from IMDB to answer questions about movies and movie stars. Forum to facilitate communication between users. Etc.
Who is the target audience? For example: The general public, family members, research scientists, students, etc.
What sort of data will it manage? This doesn’t include static data, such as logos, headers, and footers. Think of any data that will be dynamically generated based on user form input. For example, user comments, uploaded images, credit cards, etc.
Stretch Goals? Once your project is fully functional and demonstrates adequate scope, what extra features do you want to implement? What additional gold plating would make your website utterly awesome? Stretch goals aren’t part of your grade; they are just for your own satisfaction.
